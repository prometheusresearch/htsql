      SHELL - start an HTSQL shell
      Usage: htsql-ctl shell [DB]

      The routine starts an interactive HTSQL shell over the specified database.

      The DB argument specifies database connection parameters; must have the
      form:

          engine://username:password@host:port/database

      Here,

        - ENGINE is the type of the database server; supported values are
          `sqlite`, `pgsql`, `mysql`, `mssql` and `oracle`.
        - The parameters USERNAME:PASSWORD are used for authentication.
        - The parameters HOST:PORT indicate the address of the database
          server.
        - DATABASE is the name of the database; for SQLite, the path to the
          database file.

      All parameters except ENGINE and DATABASE are optional.

      When the shell is started, you will see the shell prompt with the
      database name followed by `$`.  Type an HTSQL query and press ENTER to
      execute it.  Type a command with any arguments and press ENTER to
      execute the command.  In particular, use `help` to get a list of shell
      commands, `help <command>` to describe a command.

      Type `exit` or Ctrl-D to exit the shell.

      Shell commands: (run 'htsql-ctl help shell <command>' for more help)
        help [command]           : describe the shell or a shell command
        version                  : print version and license information
        exit                     : quit the shell
        user [remote_user]       : set the remote user for HTTP requests

        pager on|off             : pipe long output to a pager
        [get] /query             : execute an HTSQL query
        post filename /query     : execute an HTSQL query with POST data

      Arguments:

      Valid options:
        -p [--password]          : ask for the database password
        -E [--extension] EXT [+] : include extra extensions

      respectively.

      If the pager is enabled, and the number of lines in the HTTP response
      exceeds the height of the terminal, the response is displayed via the
      pager.

      The pager is a command which allows you to scroll and search in the
      output.  The pager application is determined by the environment variable
      $PAGER.  When $PAGER is not set, one of the common pagers such as
      `/usr/bin/more` is used if available.  The pager could only be enabled
      when the shell is running in a terminal.

      of the terminal, the output is displayed via the pager.  Use `pager off`
      to disable the pager.

      By default, the command does not dump the response status line and the

      POST - execute an HTSQL query with POST data
      Usage: post filename /query

      Type `post filename /query` or `post filename content-type /query` to
      execute an HTSQL query with POST data.

      The content of the POST request is read from the file `filename`.  You
      can optionally specify the content type of the POST data as a second
      parameter.  If content type is not specified, it is deduced from the
      file extension.

      The output of the query is dumped to the console.  When the pager is

      Type `run filename.htsql` to load and execute an HTSQL query from a file.

      The command reads an HTSQL query from the given file and executes it as
      a GET request.

      The output of the query is dumped to the console.  When the pager is
      enabled and the number of lines in the response body exceeds the height

      SERVER - start an HTTP server handling HTSQL requests
      Usage: htsql-ctl server [DB]

      The routine starts an HTTP server that serves HTSQL requests over the
      specified database.

      The DB argument specifies database connection parameters; must have the
      form:

          engine://username:password@host:port/database

      Here,

        - ENGINE is the type of the database server; supported values are
          `sqlite`, `pgsql`, `mysql`, `mssql` and `oracle`.
        - The parameters USERNAME:PASSWORD are used for authentication.
        - The parameters HOST:PORT indicate the address of the database
          server.
        - DATABASE is the name of the database; for SQLite, the path to the
          database file.

      All parameters except ENGINE and DATABASE are optional.

      By default, the HTTP server listens on the port 8080 on all available
      interfaces.  Use options `--host` and `--port` to override the default
      values.

      The HTTP logs are dumped to the standard output in the Apache Common Log
      Format.  Use option `--quiet` to suppress the logs.

      Arguments:
        DB                       : the connection URI

      Valid options:
        -p [--password]          : ask for the database password
        -E [--extension] EXT [+] : include extra extensions
        -C [--config] FILE       : read HTSQL configuration from FILE
        --host HOST              : host to listen for incoming connections
        --port PORT              : port to listen for incoming connections
        -q [--quiet]             : display as little as possible
