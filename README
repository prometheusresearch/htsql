HTSQL -- A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
=======================================================

HTSQL ("Hyper Text Structured Query Language") is a schema-driven URI-to-SQL
translator that takes a request over HTTP, converts it to a SQL query, executes
the query against a database, and returns the results in a format best suited
for the user agent (CSV, HTML, etc.).

for details.  HTSQL is written by Clark C. Evans <cce@clarkevans.com> and
